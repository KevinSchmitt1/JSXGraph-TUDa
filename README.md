# JSXGraph
In this repository, all my JSXgraph files are uploaded.
Some of the files are jsfiddle codes, some the direct codes for implementation in moodle.

How to include JSXGraph in moodle:

First of all you need to include the STACK-question type to your running system. If moodle is used, you can find the full guide for installing STACK at:

https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md

The full guide for including a JSXGraph-task into a moodle-STACK-question is explained on http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Include_JSXGraph

There are two ways to implement the JavaScript based tool: 

1. Via online usage: Include the JavaScript file of JSXGraph in the HTML-code of the task text.

2. Via local copy: Download and include the JavaScript file of JSXGraph directly from a local repository (f.e. on the running moodle-server).

Recommendations for working with JSXGraph:

I recommend using jsfiddle.net for testing and coding a JSXGraph task. There are some complications in testing the code within moodle:

1. moodle changes the style of the code when saving the task, so it is harder to navigate within your written code in moodle.

2. jsfiddle is much faster then moodle, so you can see immediatly, how your changes and your code overall would look like.

There are many examples for JSXGraph codes on the JSXGraph-Wiki page: https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page 
Furthermore you can look up specific functions of JSXGraph on: https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/docs/index.html

The Ruhr-University in Bochum also created a tutorial for the usage of JSXGraph with examples and videos. You can get access via:
